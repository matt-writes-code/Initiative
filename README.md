### Visit us at <b>[The Initiative](https://the-initiative-code.github.io/the-initiative/)</b>

We seek to first understand your brand and who your customers are, as well as the brand message that you want to bring to them. We then go through a "mood board" phase of ideation with you in order to refine what we believe best fits your brand and message. Then we execute on the agreed upon design sketch and turn it into a website, tailored to you and your audiences' needs.
